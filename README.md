# JavaScript Ecosystem Resources, and slightly more.
I try to gather some resources about some of the technologies I use (JS Here),
and put them there. <br>
Most of these resources are free, those that are not will have a :dollar: emoji. <br>
Some of these resources may be « old », but are still relevant, in the sence that the
related topic does not change often and the knowledge seems good for the current context.

### [Computer science related](#cs-related)
> Resources about computer science, back-end/front-end engineering in general, without Libs/Frameworks heavy content.
### [JavaScript](#javascript-related)
> Anything related to JS primarily. (Most of the content is focus on JS no matter the context)
### [TypeScript](#typescript-related)
> Anything related to TS primarily. (Most of the content is focus on TS no matter the context)
### [Node.js](#node.js-related)
> Anything related to Node.js primarily, even with TS. (Most of the content is focus on Node.js no matter the context)
### [Deno](#deno-related)
> Anything related to Deno primarily, even with TS. (Most of the content is focus on Deno no matter the context)
