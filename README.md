# JavaScript Ecosystem Resources, and slightly more.
I try to gather some resources about some of the technologies I use,
and put them there. <br>
Most of these resources are free, those that are not will have a :dollar: emoji. <br>
Some of these resources may be « old », but are still relevant, in the sense that the
related topic does not change often and the knowledge seems good for the current context.

All resources, channels or whatever, should be in English, to help the most possible numbers of people.

### [Computer science related](#cs-related)
> Resources about computer science, back-end/front-end engineering in general, without Libs/Frameworks heavy content (JS ones).
> Resources about Databases, mostly within the context of Node.js and Deno (Any way to persist data). Resources within the programming
> context but not primarily related to JavaScript. (Clean code, etc)
### [JavaScript](#javascript-related)
> Anything related to JS primarily. (Most of the content is focus on JS no matter the context)
### [TypeScript](#typescript-related)
> Anything related to TS primarily. (Most of the content is focus on TS no matter the context)
### [Node.js](#node.js-related)
> Anything related to Node.js primarily, even with TS. (Most of the content is focus on Node.js no matter the context)
### [Deno](#deno-related)
> Anything related to Deno primarily, even with TS. (Most of the content is focus on Deno no matter the context)
### [Other](#other-content)
> Anything Framework/Libraries heavy content related to the JS Ecosystem, no matter what is the runtime.
> Also stuff related to anything JS but in other programming language ecosystem,
> like embedding JS Engines, etc.
### [Attributions](#attribution-for-icons)
> Anything icons/images attributions
